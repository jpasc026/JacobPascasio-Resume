        <p class="lead mb-4">As the eldest of four children, and coming from a family of nine members, being in a chaotic and bustling environment is no surprise to me. I currently attend the University of California at Riverside, where I am majoring in Business Administration. I hope to receive my Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in the summer of 2025. At the University of California Riverside, I am a part of the Surf Club and Katipunan Filipino Culture Club. I hope to attain leadership roles in both clubs. In the Surf Club, I am currently working towards becoming the Treasurer, and I hope to become a peer mentor in the Katipunan Filipino Culture Club during my Sophomore Year, which is next year. <br><br>

        I graduated from Chaminade College Preparatory High School, which is one of the top private schools in the Greater San Fernando Valley area. I graduated with Laureate Honors, which is the highest academic recognition awarded to students at my school. I founded the Filipino Culture Club, which was very successful at my school. I hosted many fundraising events, and even helped raise $1000 for the Philippine Disaster and Relief Organization during one of the most devastating typhoons that hit the country in 2019. I was also the Events Coordinator and Music Director of Chaminadeâ€™s Campus Ministry Team, the Events Coordinator of the Diversity Team, and the Leader of the Cultural Council. I was also a member of the Mental Health Committee and a Varsity Member of both the Track and Field and Cross Country Teams at my school. I was a leader and practice coordinator for my Cross Country and Track and Field Teams and assisted in activities such as leading team stretches and drills during practice. I was very successful in all of these clubs and activities and was very passionate about these clubs since my Freshman Year. During my time at Chaminade College Preparatory, I also attained the Scholar Athlete Award and was a selected member of the National Honor Society. <br><br>

       Having volunteered at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Woodland Hills, California, I have experience in a fast-paced working environment. I volunteered here for about four months from June 2019 to September 2019. Here, I volunteered by pushing elderly patients to and from appointments, assisting the nursing staff with patient rounds and various checkups, and helping visitors navigate through the hospital. I also shadowed a physician during the Summer of 2018. I helped the physician with her rounds and grew close connections with the fellow shadows, patients, and staff. I currently work at Wang Cho Korean BBQ in Riverside, California as a busser. My tasks include cleaning tables after customers have helped, ensuring the cleanliness of the restaurant, and maintaining a fast-flowing and stable-flowing restaurant environment. It is a very physically demanding and fast-paced job, but I am sure that this experience together with my experiences at Kaiser Permanente Hospital ensure that I am a viable candidate for any job needed. I am looking forward to learning and gaining experience in any job.
